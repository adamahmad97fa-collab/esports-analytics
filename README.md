## Idea
This project reflects analytics workflows I’ve used in professional esports, where data-driven decision making is critical to competitive success. I built this tool to demonstrate how match data can be collected, analysed, and transformed into actionable insights to support preparation ahead of competitions and tournaments.

## Sample Output
- Overall win rate
- Win rate by map (visualised as a bar chart)
- Identification of strong and weak maps to support strategic focus and map veto decisions
