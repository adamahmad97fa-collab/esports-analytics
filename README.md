\## Motivation

This project was inspired by my experience in professional esports, where data-driven decision making is critical. I built this tool to demonstrate how match data can be collected, analysed, and transformed into actionable insights using standard data analytics tools.



\## Sample Output

\- Overall win rate

\- Win rate by map (visualised as a bar chart)

\- Identification of strong and weak maps to support strategic focus



\- Automated identification of strongest and weakest maps to support decision-making





\## Tech Stack

Python • Pandas • SQLite • Matplotlib
