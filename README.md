\## Idea 
This project is similar to things I've built in the past in esports, where data-driven decision making is critical to success. I built this simple tool to demonstrate how match data can be collected, analysed and transformed into something I could use to take action and prepare better when approaching a competition/tournament.

\## Sample Output

\- Overall win rate

\- Win rate by map (visualised as a bar chart)

\- Shows strong and weak maps to support strategic focus, know what maps to veto.

\## Tech Stack

Python • Pandas • SQLite • Matplotlib
