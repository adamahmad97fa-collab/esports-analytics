# Esports Match Analytics

## Overview
This project analyses competitive esports match data to understand team performance and map strengths. It shows how raw match data can be stored, analysed, and turned into insights that support preparation and strategic decision-making.

## Why I Built This
I’ve used data analysis in professional esports environments, where small performance differences can decide matches. I built this project to reflect those real workflows and to demonstrate how match data can be used to guide preparation ahead of competitions and tournaments.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- SQLite  
- Matplotlib  

## Data
The project uses structured match-level data stored in a SQLite database. The data is cleaned and standardised before analysis so results can be compared consistently across matches and maps.

## What the Project Does
- Calculates overall win rate  
- Breaks down win rate by map  
- Identifies strongest and weakest maps  
- Produces visualisations to support strategic focus and map veto decisions

## Sample Output
- Overall win rate  
- Win rate by map (bar chart)
